                <p>This project was created using React and Joke-API</p>
                <h2>On the technical side:</h2>
                <p>This is a front-end project, and its built mainly using <span>React</span> and <span>Bootstrap</span>. </p>
                <p>We use <span>Axios</span> to send HTTP requests to the API, sending all the queries from the user.</p>
                <p>Each and every parameter in the Menu section has its own <span>UseState Hook</span>, and we manipulate the API request according to those hooks states.</p>
                <p><span>React router v6</span> is implemented here in order to render both the Home and About Screens. </p>
                <p>The jokes are coming from <span>Joke-API - "https://sv443.net/jokeapi/v2/" -</span> all rights reserved.</p>
