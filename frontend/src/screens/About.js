                <p>This is a front-end project, and its built mainly using <a href="https://reactjs.org/" className="about-links">React</a> and <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/" className="about-links">Bootstrap</a>. </p>
                <p>We use <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios" className="about-links">Axios</a> to send HTTP requests to the API, sending all the queries from the user.</p>
                <p>Each and every parameter in the Menu section has its own <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-state.html" className="about-links">UseState Hook</a>, and we manipulate the API request according to those hooks states.</p>
                <p><a href="https://reactrouter.com/" className="about-links">React router v6</a> is implemented here in order to render both the Home and About Screens. </p>
