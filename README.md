# GET-JOKES!
A Front-End React project, Built in order to implement the foundations of React development.

We use <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios">Axios</a> to send HTTP requests to the API, sending all the queries from the user.  
Each and every parameter in the Menu section has its own <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-state.html">UseState Hook</a>, and we manipulate the API request according to those hooks states.  
<a href="https://reactrouter.com/">React router v6</a> is implemented here in order to render both the Home and About Screens.  

The jokes are coming from <a href="https://sv443.net/jokeapi/v2/">Jokes-API</a>
